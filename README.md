## DAQ or darts_async_query

This package is a free interpretation of the react_query (or tanstack query, rtkq, etc.) concept in Flutter.

I'm gonna be honest - this is not my first try on creating a package like that, at some point I got tired of implementing all of the basic things and resorted to asking Cursor to create some basic models, functions, etc for me.

It's not a 100 percent tested solution, but I intend to use it on the projects that I'm working on - so the improvements and updates should be constant.

The package is based entirely on flutter_hooks, and, unfortunately, doesn't offer pure flutter alternatives at the moment.
